											<p>This videos show Boca Juniors' fans, which are better known as "Player number 12" or simply "La 12" </p>

											<h3>Why this name?</h3>
											<p>In 1924, the Argentina's Football Asociation (amateur football) wanted to create a national team to represent the country in a tournament in Europe, in an attempt to make football grow in the country. As they couldn't get to an agreement, Boca Jrs offered to take their player to represent the country in the international level. 
												That is why in 1925, a delegetion of 21 people left to represent Argentina. Between these people, there was one called "Victoriano Agustin Caffarena" who was a huge fan of Boca Jrs. Despite his wealth, he still needed to sell some properties not only to pay for his ticket, but to help some of the players that couldn't afford to travel, showing his devotion for the club.
												Once the team got to Europe, Caffarena started taking on different roles like water boy, masseuse for the players and even manager of the team. It was because of this and his importance for the group that one of the players (top scorer of the torunament) called him "the Player N°12". Again in Argentina, "the Player N°12" kept a really important role in the club, being not only a life member, but also working for the club. Later on he would go on to be the President of the club, until he died in 1972.
											</p>

											<p>That is not all though, in 1940 once the club presented their stadium "La Bombonera"	a writer refered to the fans as the "Player N°12" because of their fervent way of encouraging the team. Over the years, the term varely varied or changed from "Player N°12" to simply "La 12" or "The 12th".
												As for the stadium, it is also one of the craziest things in "La Boca". Even though it is not one of the biggest stadiums in regards to the amount of people it fits, it is one of the most feared ones, because there's a myth (it actually happens) that the stadium "shakes" or "trembles" because of the fans chants and jumps (as shown in the videos). That is why many teams usually have a bad time playing in that stadium, becuase people live football in La Boca, and whenever you come in that stadium Boca Jrs fans make that clear.
